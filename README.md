# Jeep Mods

## Getting the Jeep
I got my Jeep on **12/25/19**, and since then, it has become my main project vehicle. I've been adding and modifying components bit by bit, aiming to improve both the functionality and the look of the Jeep. Here are some of the modifications I've made and what I've learned throughout the process.

### Rocker Switch & Interior Lights
One of the first mods I did was installing a **rocker switch** for some interior strip lights. I purchased the **rocker switch**, **LED strip lights**, and **wiring harness** from Amazon. The idea was to have easy control over the lights from the **A-pillar switch panel**.

- **Wiring the Switch**: The most challenging part of this mod was getting the wiring harness through the firewall. Initially, it took me about **30 minutes** to find a suitable hole and get the harness through. Interestingly, on a later project, I discovered a different hole in the firewall that would have taken only **20 seconds** to use. Lesson learned.
- **Connecting the Lights**: Once the harness was through, I connected it to the **battery** and routed the wiring back through the firewall to reach under the passenger seat, where the controller for the lights is mounted.

### Train Horn Installation
I found a **train horn** at an auto salvage yard, and the installation process was similar to the interior lights.
- I used the preexisting **firewall hole** I found on the second attempt to run the wiring harness, which made the process much faster. 
- The train horn was a fun addition, but I've been considering removing it to repurpose the rocker switch and wiring harness for a **PA system** instead.

### Push-to-Start Project
The push-to-start mod was ambitious but ultimately didn’t work out. I purchased a **Banvie on-off push switch** and controller, as well as a **race car push-to-start button** with an arming switch. The plan was to wire these into the **A-pillar** to use instead of the Banvie button.

- **Wiring Challenges**: I spent hours wiring and testing the system, and while the engine would crank, it wouldn’t turn over. I eventually learned that **Jeeps use a CANbus system**, which relies on **ohms** and **micro-voltages** to send signals to start the engine. Essentially, this makes it impossible to “hotwire” the vehicle, which is essentially what the Banvie system was doing. 
- **Returning the Parts**: The CANbus system actually makes sense for Jeeps, considering they often have the **doors and roof off**, which could make them more vulnerable to theft. It probably saved many Jeeps from being stolen, but it meant I had to return all the push-to-start components.

### Painting the Interior
I decided to customize the look of my Jeep's interior by painting the **center dash** and panels **black**.
- **Process**: I ripped out the center of the dash and painted it. My long-term goal is to have a **black and tan/camel interior**, so I’m taking it step by step.
- **Challenges with Panels**: While the middle panel looks great and functions perfectly, the **vertical side panels** around it scratched easily despite the **spray paint and clear coat**. For future panels, I plan to use a **plastic adhesion promoter** to make the paint job more durable.

### Miscellaneous Fixes & Upgrades (Part 2)
#### Replacing the Pitman Arm to Drag Link End
I recently replaced the **pitman arm to drag link end**, which was a time-consuming job but should hopefully reduce the **steering play** in the Jeep.

#### Interior Lights Wiring Issues
The interior lights sometimes work, but they have been inconsistent. I need to rewire the setup for more reliable performance.

#### Android Screen Upgrade
I installed a **10.1-inch Android screen** to replace the stock head unit. It adds modern functionality and looks great in the dashboard.

#### Evap Leak Fix
I still need to get some **sheet metal** to clamp between the exhaust clamps to properly seal the evap system and fix a persistent leak.

#### Rear Sway Bar Link Bearings
The **rear sway bar link bearings** need replacing. After some trial and error, I found the perfect **M12 bolts** that fit well and shouldn't keep snapping like the previous bolts.

### Regearing Dilemma
I’ve been researching and planning to **regear the Jeep** myself. Typically, labor costs for this job can be around **$1,000**, which is steep, but it makes me curious about doing it on my own. I’m considering regearing to **4.88s**, the same ratio as stock Rubicons. However, my **Sahara** model comes stock with **4.10s** and features a **Dana 44** axle in the rear and a **Dana 30** in the front.

- **Considering Bigger Axles**: If I want to go with **bigger wheels** in the future, I may need to upgrade to **stronger axles**. This poses a dilemma: regearing the current **Dana 44** could be a waste if I eventually upgrade to **Dana 50s**. 
- **Budget Constraints**: Currently, I don’t have the budget to do the full upgrade—bigger axles, regear, and new wheels all go hand-in-hand. For now, I might just stick to the stock axles and consider a regear when the time is right.

## Final Thoughts
This Jeep has been a constant project and learning experience, from interior mods and electrical work to mechanical upgrades. Every fix or upgrade has taught me more about how my vehicle works and has given me the confidence to tackle more ambitious projects in the future.
