Got the Jeep 12/25/19

-rocker switch wired up to interior strip lights

I bought the rocker switch, lights, and wiring harness on amazon and just wired the rocker switch to the preexisting panel on my a-pillar. It was hard getting the wiring harness throught the firewall but I found a small hole and after about half an hour I managed to get the harness through (on another project I found a hole in the firewall that takes about 20 seconds to use. I then wired the harness to the battery and back through the firewall to under the passenger seat where the controller for the lights is.

-train horn

I found a train horn at a auto salvage place and basically did the same thing as with the interior lights but this time I found and used the preexisting firewall hole. I'm planning to take the horn off in order to use its rocker switch and harness for a PA system.

-push to start

This project took a lot of time and wiring to eventually not work. I bought an on off push switch and controller from ban vie as well as a race car push to start and arming switch which I planned to wire to the a pillar to use instead of banvie's button. After hours of testing and wiring and the engine cranking but not turning over, I came in contact with someone that explained to me how Jeeps use canbus which uses ohms and micro voltages to tell the engine to start which means that you can't hot wire it which is essentially what the banvie system did. I guess the canbus makes sense for jeeps considering the doors and roof will be off for a good portion of its life. Probably saved many jeeps from being stolen but I had to return all of the parts

-painting interior

I ripped apart the center of the dash and painted it all black. I plan to make the whole interior black and tan/camel but it will take a while so I'm doing it step by step. The middle panel works perfect and looks great. However, the vertical panels running along the sides of the middle panel allow the spray paint and clear coat to scratch off way too easily so I'll need to get a plastic adhesion promoter.



pt 2

Just replaced the pittman arm to drag link end. Took a while but I hope its worth it for the steering play.

Still need to rewire the interior lights. They work sometimes but usually don't

Got the 10.1in Android screen working

I really need to go get some sheet metal to clamp in-between the exhaust clamps so I don't have an evap leak.

Also really need to replace the rear sway bar link bearings, I finally found the perfect M12 bolts that work and shouldn't keep snapping.

I've been really looking into regearing the Jeep by myself, but usually to pay someone, the labor alone is 1k. Maybe this should be a sign that the labor is hard and complicated but I still would like to try it. I think I want to go to 4.88s, the same as the stock rubicons. Because I have a Sahara, it comes with stocks 4.10s and a dana 44 in the rear and 30 in the front. I've reached a dilema where I'd like to get beefier axels especially if I want to also get bigger wheels, and in that I shouldn't spend the money regearing a dana 44. However, I don't nearly have the money to get dana 50s and regear them and get bigger wheels, however, they all go hand and hand.
